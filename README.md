# README

I used this project to practice my backend development skills most notably with an emphasis on authentication of users utilising the devise gem. Front end wise I have kept it very basic using bootstrap (normally i'd prefer to use React.js for front end development with Rails API running the backend).

### Ideas

Focusing on my skills with relational databases Im looking to implement the following functionality: 

* Add users ability to create (CRUD) posts.

* Add users option to like/ unlike posts.

* Add users option to add/remove friends.
